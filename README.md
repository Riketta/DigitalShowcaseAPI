# Overview
DigitalShowcase - an academic project to explore new technologies for me, and to improve in stuff already known to me.  
I tried to apply in it the best practices found (or at least good ones). This did not happen in every part, but at least not optimal places were localized for the future.  

This is not a shop (at the moment), but namely showcase.  
It is absolutely not recommended to use this in real (production) projects, despite the fact that I tried to make this product as secure as possible using various OWASP (and others) recommendations.  
Although, if only because the project is still far from being complete.
